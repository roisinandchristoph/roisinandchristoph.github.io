    <h1>Wedding Itinerary</h1>
    <h3>Bachelor's Singleton</h3>
    <script = type="text/javascript">thechoff();</script> will be going for a pint.
    <h3>Church Ceremony</h3>
    A Catholic ceremony will take place at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trinity+College+Chapel/@53.3447226,-6.2601957,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x48670e9b271ad431:0xb02988d92bdebfc4!8m2!3d53.3447194!4d-6.2580017?hl=nl">Trinity College Chapel</a> at 2pm.
    <!-- The Chapel is an Anglican-style church that was built in 1798. -->
    Please take your seats inside the church (either side) by 13:50.
    <h3>Reception and Dinner</h3>
    After the ceremony, we will celebrate at the <a href="https://www.fitzpatrickcastle.com/">Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel</a> in Killiney, about 15km south-east of Trinity. A drinks reception will be held from 15:30-17:30 in the Dungeon Bar, after which we will have dinner in the Albert &amp; Behan Suite. After dinner there will be music, and if you get hungry again, a few hours later there will be some sausages and sandwiches. If your thirst is not quenched by the time the bar closes at half two, the resident's bar will be open until four.
    <h3>Morning Swim</h3>
    If anyone is staying in Killiney, the next morning we will shaking off the hangover at the nearby <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vico+Bathing+Place/@53.2690989,-6.1000038,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x486707b03b15c2a1:0x9b27822a045a6854!8m2!3d53.2690957!4d-6.0978151?hl=nl">Vico</a>, the finest bathing place in Dublin.
