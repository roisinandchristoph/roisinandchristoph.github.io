    <h2>Transport</h2>
    <h4>To Trinity</h4>
    Trinity does not have its own parking facilities, but there are many parking garages very close to the college. For example (all similarly-priced per hour):
    <ul>
      <li>Brown Thomas, 49 Clarendon St.
      <li>Q-Park Setanta Place, Molesworth Street
      <li>Park Rite, 52-57 Fleet Street
    </ul>
    If taking public transportation, Trinity College very well connected to the Luas, DART and bus lines:
    <ul>
      <li>Luas (tram): Trinity Stop
      <li>DART (train): Pearse Street
      <li>Bus: Many bus routes pass through College Green or Nassau Street, both right next to Trinity. Check Google Maps for bus routes.
    <h4>To Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel from Trinity</h4>
    If driving, The Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel has on-site parking which is free of charge, and there is also street parking nearby.<br>

    We are arranging a minibus to the Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel from Trinity after the ceremony. The exact details will follow.

    <br>
    The reception will run very late so guests can leave by taxi at their own leisure.
