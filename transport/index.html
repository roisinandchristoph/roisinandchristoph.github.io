    <h2>Logistics</h2>
    <h4>To Trinity</h4>
    If driving, Trinity does not have its own parking facilities, but there are many parking garages very close to the college. For example (all similarly-priced per hour):
    <ul>
      <li>Brown Thomas, 49 Clarendon St.
      <li>Q-Park Setanta Place, Molesworth Street
      <li>Park Rite, 52-57 Fleet Street
    </ul>
    If taking public transportation, Trinity College is very close to the Trinity Luas Stop, Tara or Pearse Street DART/commuter rail stations. Dozens of bus routes also pass through College Green (check Google Maps for bus routes from your hotel).<br>
    <h4>To Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel</h4>
    If driving, The Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel has on-site parking which is free of charge, and there is also street parking nearby.<br>

    We have arranged for a <b>50-seat minibus to the Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel</b> from Trinity after the ceremony. It will depart from Nassau Street at 15:00.

    <br>
    If you miss this, the DART commuter train from either Tara St. or Pearse St. to Dalkey station is another alternative.<br>
    The bar at the reception will run very late so guests can leave by taxi at their own leisure.
